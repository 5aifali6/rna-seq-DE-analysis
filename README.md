# ðŸ§¬ RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis (GSE60424)

This project performs **differential gene expression analysis** using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) in R on the publicly available **RNA-Seq dataset GSE60424**. The goal is to identify genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in **LPS-stimulated immune cells** compared to **control** conditions.

### ðŸ”¬ Volcano Plot

![Volcano Plot](results/volcano_plot.png)

> **Interpretation**:  
This volcano plot visualizes differential gene expression based on:
- **X-axis**: Log2 Fold Change (magnitude of change)
- **Y-axis**: â€“log10(P-value) (statistical significance)  
Each point represents a gene:
- **Top right**: significantly **upregulated** genes in LPS-stimulated samples  
- **Top left**: significantly **downregulated** genes  
- The further away a gene is from the center, the stronger and more significant the regulation.

Use this plot to **identify key immune response genes or biomarkers** triggered by LPS stimulation.

### ðŸ§¬ PCA Plot

![PCA Plot](results/pca_plot.png)

> **Interpretation**:  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) summarizes the gene expression variation:
- Each point represents a **sample**
- **Color** represents the sample group (LPS vs Control)
- **PC1 and PC2** represent the major axes of expression variance

The plot shows clear **group separation**, indicating that LPS stimulation leads to a **global shift in gene expression**, highlighting its **strong biological effect**.

### ðŸ§ª Heatmap of Top 30 DEGs

![Heatmap](results/heatmap.png)

> **Interpretation**:  
This heatmap displays the expression of the **top 30 most variable genes** across all samples:
- **Rows**: Genes (ENSEMBL IDs)
- **Columns**: Samples
- **Colors**: Red = high expression, Blue = low expression

Clustering shows that **samples within the same group cluster together**, and certain genes exhibit **consistent expression patterns** across conditions. This supports the reliability of the DE results and hints at possible **gene modules** activated or suppressed by LPS stimulation.
